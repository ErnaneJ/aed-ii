#### ✅ Week 02
- [![Open in PDF](https://img.shields.io/badge/-PDF-EC1C24?style=flat-square&logo=adobeacrobatreader)](https://github.com/ivanovitchm/datastructure/tree/main/lessons/week_02/week_02.pdf) **Review:** topics covered include Recursion, Binary Search Trees (BST), and AVL Trees.
- 🎯 Week Goals 
    - Your main goal for this week is related to following subjects: recursion, binary and avl trees. By the conclusion, you'll have the ability to distinguish between iteration and recursion, learn how to construct and query datasets using Binary Search Trees (BST) and get acquaninted with AVL trees.
